An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine told the story of Clyde
Murphy, a black man who was a member of the Class of 1970.
Clyde was a success story. After Yale and a law degree from
Columbia, Clyde spent the next 30 years as one of America's top
civil rights lawyers. He was also a great husband and father. But
despite his success, personally and professionally, Clyde's story

had a sad ending.

In 2010, at the age of 62, Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.
Clyde's experience was not unique. Many of his black
classmates from Yale also died young. In fact, the magazine
article indicated that 41 years after graduation from Yale, the
black members of the Class of 1970 had a death rate that was
three times higher than that of the average class member. It's

stunning.
